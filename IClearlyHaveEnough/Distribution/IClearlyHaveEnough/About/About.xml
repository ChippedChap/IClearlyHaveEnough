A mini-mod that makes the resource readout when designating blueprints consider the amount of resources on the entire map, as opposed to stored resources only.

This is so that it won't complain to you when you can see you clearly have enough on the map.

The mod also changes the window on the architect tab that shows you how much each blueprint needs, so if you Clearly Have Enough, the text won't be red.

Note: This mod (from v1.0.0 and possibly onwards) uses a MapComponent to improve performance for low-end computers. MapComponents are saved along with your savegame, so uninstalling and loading a save where this mod is used will give you an error. However, this error is easily eliminated by overwriting your savefile without the mod loaded, which won't corrupt your savefile or do anything bad.

This mod now only counts all the resources on the map every 204 ticks (3.4 seconds on normal speed, same update rate as the vanilla resource counter.) If the counts don't look correct, just advance time faster and it should update sooner.
