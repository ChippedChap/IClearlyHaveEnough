A mini-mod that makes the resource readout when designating blueprints consider the amount of resources on the entire map, as opposed to stored resources only.

This is so that it won't complain to you when you can see you clearly have enough on the map.

Also useful during early game, where you won't have most things on the map stockpiled properly.
