	<description>A mini-mod that makes the resource readout when designating blueprints consider the amount of resources on the entire map, as opposed to stored resources only.

This is so that it won't complain to you when you can see you clearly have enough on the map.

The mod also changes the window on the architect tab that shows you how much each blueprint needs, so if you Clearly Have Enough, the text won't be red.
